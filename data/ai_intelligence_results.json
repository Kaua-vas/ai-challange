        "I purchased a used 2017 Ford Escape SE with EcoBoost engine (2.0L) at 58,000 miles in April of 2024. In September 2024, the check engine light came on, followed shortly thereafter by overheating of the engine. This overheating would cause the engine to go into limp mode on the highway, which happened multiple times. When inspecting the coolant tank, it was discovered that coolant was leaking out, and the tank did not retain new coolant poured in.  The issue was determined by both the Ford dealership and a third-party mechanic to be coolant intrusion, requiring replacement of the engine long block. Upon researching the issue, discovered that Ford's customer service program 21N12 covers replacement for engines of this year and model, but was informed by Ford that recall/replacement was not covered as the engine on my vehicle was not 1.5L. Clearly, whether the engine is 1.5L, 1.6L, or 2.0L, the issue exists. The $8,300 fix has created a serious financial burden, as I had to pay out-of-pocket to fix Ford's known mistake.   There is currently a class-action lawsuit against Ford for this issue: [XXX] , et al. v. Ford Motor Co ([XXX]). In the class-action, it is reported that buyers' engines have burst into flames due to this issue. In my case, the vehicle went into limp mode on the freeway, and could easily have caused a serious wreck - I am thankful that I was able to get the vehicle off of the road and into the shop before there was a wreck. These vehicles are active liabilities on the roads, and should be recalled as soon as possible. INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",
